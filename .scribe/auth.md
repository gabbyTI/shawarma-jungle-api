# Authenticating requests

Authenticate requests to this API's endpoints by sending an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve a token from the json response of a successful login request.
